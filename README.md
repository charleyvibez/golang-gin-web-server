# Example Web App written in Go

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [Go](https://golang.org/) web applications on Simplifyd.

It is based on the [realtime chat](https://github.com/gin-gonic/examples/tree/master/realtime-advanced) example powered by the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

The sample app is up at https://go-gin.simplifyd.app.
